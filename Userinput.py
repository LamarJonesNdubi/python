# today i will be trying to code a user input and make it accept user input as well.
# we an have the 'name' valerable to store the name instead.
# since i am using a vs code editor it seems i cant input my name in the output box..
# unless you click the 'down arrow' on your right next to the execution button.
# and and click "run python file" instead of "run code".

print("Hello There..please be patient as i gather data form for you.")
name = str(input("Enter your name: "))
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(f"Nice to see you {name} its been a long time.")
